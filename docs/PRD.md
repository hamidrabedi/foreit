## 1. Product summary

forge is a Django-inspired Go framework intended to reduce boilerplate in CRUD web apps while increasing safety.

The value proposition, consistent with archived docs, is:

- Schema-first model definition in Go (`forge/schema`).
- AST-based code generation for type-safe managers/querysets (`forge/codegen`).
- ORM/query engine (`forge/orm`) and reusable filtering (`forge/filter`).
- A built-in admin system (`forge/admin`) that can be extended/overridden.
- A DRF-like REST API layer (`forge/api`) with serializers/viewsets/auth/permissions/throttling.
- A migration engine (`forge/db/migrate`) with CLI orchestration (`forge/cli`).
- An identity system (`forge/identity`) with sessions/tokens/passwords.

The product is validated by a multi-module test suite (unit tests + integration tests in `tests/`).

## 2. Goals

### 2.1 Primary goals

1. Enable developers to build CRUD apps quickly without sacrificing correctness.
2. Provide predictable, repeatable migrations.
3. Offer a powerful, secure admin interface out of the box.
4. Provide a consistent REST API framework with first-class errors, auth, and filtering.
5. Provide identity as a built-in system that can be overridden.

### 2.2 Secondary goals

1. Support both server-rendered and SPA admin experiences.
2. Allow plugin systems for admin widgets and API enhancements.
3. Keep code generation deterministic and safe.

## 3. Non-goals

- Being an unopinionated micro-library.
- Supporting every database equally; Postgres is the primary target.
- Guaranteeing zero breaking changes between major versions.
- Using reflection for the default ORM API.

## 4. Personas

### 4.1 Backend engineer

- Wants fast model definition.
- Needs safe migrations.
- Expects type-safe queries.

### 4.2 Platform engineer

- Wants predictable CLI workflows.
- Needs auth/security primitives.
- Wants the ability to constrain behavior (e.g., filter whitelists).

### 4.3 Admin/product operator

- Uses admin UI daily.
- Needs robust filtering/search/export.
- Needs permissioning and audit trails.

### 4.4 API consumer developer

- Uses REST endpoints.
- Needs consistent errors, pagination, filtering.

## 5. Key user journeys

This section is intentionally concrete. Every journey should be supported by code and tests.

### 5.1 Bootstrap a project

1. Developer runs `forge new myapp`.
2. CLI scaffolds directory structure and config.
3. Developer runs `forge runserver`.

Success:

- Server starts without manual wiring.
- Sample routes and admin URL respond.

Evidence:

- CLI template references exist in `forge/cli/templates/templates/*`.
- `forge/cli/commands/server/runserver.go` is implemented.

### 5.2 Define a model and generate code

1. Developer writes `app/blog/models.go` defining schema types.
2. Developer runs `forge generate`.
3. Generated files compile and expose typed managers and fields.

Success:

- Generated QuerySet supports `Filter`, `OrderBy`, `Limit`, `Values`, etc.
- Field expressions allow typed conditions.

Evidence:

- `forge/codegen/ast_parser.go`, templates under `forge/codegen/templates`.

### 5.3 Create migrations and apply them

1. Developer runs `forge makemigrations initial --auto`.
2. Up/down SQL is generated, including bookkeeping.
3. Developer runs `forge migrate up`.

Success:

- DB schema matches model definitions.
- Status is reported accurately.

Evidence:

- `forge/db/migrate/*`, `forge/db/migrations.go`, and `tests/integration/migrate/*`.

### 5.4 Use admin for CRUD

1. Developer registers models via admin registry or auto-discovery.
2. Operator visits `/admin/`.
3. Operator lists objects, filters, edits, exports.

Success:

- List view supports filtering/search/pagination.
- Forms are generated from schema metadata.
- Permissions are enforced.

Evidence:

- `forge/admin/*` plus ecommerce example admin code.

### 5.5 Expose REST APIs

1. Developer defines serializer and viewset.
2. Developer registers routes.
3. Consumers use endpoints.

Success:

- CRUD endpoints include pagination/filtering.
- Errors are consistent problem details.
- Auth and permissions enforce access.

Evidence:

- `forge/api/*` plus tests (`forge/api/*_test.go`).

### 5.6 Authenticate users

1. User signs in via identity endpoints.
2. Session/token is created.
3. Subsequent API/admin requests are authenticated.

Success:

- Password strength and reset flows work.
- Tokens expire correctly.
- Middleware sets request identity.

Evidence:

- `forge/identity/*` and tests (`forge/identity/service/*_test.go`).

## 6. Functional requirements

Functional requirements are grouped by subsystem.

### 6.1 Schema system

- avoid unnecessary joins
- cost scoring

NFR-PERF-3: Migration generation should not require a running DB

NFR-MAINT-2: Avoid global side effects at import time when possible.

NFR-MAINT-3: Prefer registries and interfaces.

## 8. Compatibility policy

The archived docs referenced v1/v2 transitions. The current stance:

- Major version changes may break APIs.
- Any breaking change must update:
  - code
  - tests
  - these docs
  - examples

## 9. Observability and operability

### 9.1 Logging

- Use structured logging (`forge/log/*`).
- Log request IDs and relevant error codes.

### 9.2 Metrics

- Throttling and filter cost scoring are a first step.
- Future: Prometheus/OTel integration.

### 9.3 Health checks

- Server health endpoints should exist and be used by deployments.

### 9.4 Operational workflows

- `forge migrate status` to inspect status.
- `forge migrate force` or recovery commands for dirty state.

## 10. Risks and mitigations

### 10.1 Risk: codegen/migration drift

If AST parser and schema builder options diverge, migrations become invalid.

Mitigations:

- maintain tests that cover option mapping (e.g., generated columns)
- keep state loader robust

### 10.2 Risk: admin override instability

If overriding admin requires editing core `main.go`, it becomes unmaintainable.

Mitigations:

- registry-centric design
- plugin hooks

### 10.3 Risk: filter system security

Filters can allow data exfiltration or expensive queries.

Mitigations:

- whitelist
- cost scoring
- query planner

### 10.4 Risk: identity coupling

If identity is too coupled, apps cannot replace it.

Mitigations:

- backend interfaces
- middleware boundaries

## 11. Acceptance criteria and quality gates

Acceptance criteria are primarily test-based.

### 11.1 Must-pass tests

- `go test ./forge/...`
- `go test ./examples/ecommerce/...`
- `go test ./tests/...`

### 11.2 Migration acceptance

- migration generator produces deterministic filenames.
- incremental migrations pass in ecommerce tests.
- recovery/status tests pass.

### 11.3 CLI acceptance

- CLI e2e tests can execute `forge makemigrations` and see output.
- CLI helper can build `forge` binary when missing.

### 11.4 Security acceptance

- identity tests cover password/token expiry.
- filter security tests cover whitelist and parser behavior.

## 12. Open questions

These are deliberate unknowns that should be decided before major expansions:

1. Admin UI direction: SPA-first vs server-rendered as default.
2. Multi-tenancy strategy.
3. Database support beyond Postgres/SQLite.
4. Caching strategy (app-level vs framework-managed).
5. How far to take auto-generated API surface (OpenAPI + client generation vs minimal).
