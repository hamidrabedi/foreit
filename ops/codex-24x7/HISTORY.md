# History
### Codex Run
- Improved schema field lookup case insensitivity (`GetField` in `forge/orm/schema.go`), ensuring safe accessors work seamlessly when accessing via PascalCase or snake_case interchangeably.
- Added extensive `SafeAccessor` unit tests that correctly mirror full Forge model definitions.

## 2026-02-12 23:20:03
- Batch: API permission reflection reliability + TODO test closure (framework API)
- Changed: fixed reflection helper behavior in `forge/api/permissions/helpers.go` so pointer-receiver methods are detected correctly and nil values are handled safely for method/field access.
- Tests: replaced placeholder TODO assertions with concrete checks in `forge/api/permissions/permission_test.go` (`TestIsAdminUser_Admin`, `TestIsOwnerOrReadOnly_Owner`); ran `go test ./api/permissions` (pass) and `go test ./...` in `examples/ecommerce` (pass/no test files).

- Batch: identity permission-check reliability (API/server auth)
- Changed: replaced the `RequirePermission` TODO in `forge/identity/middleware/auth.go` by integrating `PermissionService.CheckPermission`, added active-user enforcement, preserved superuser bypass, and kept a backward-compatible staff fallback for non-wired setups; added `NewAuthenticationMiddlewareWithPermissionService(...)` and wired it in `forge/identity/router.go`.
- Tests: added `forge/identity/middleware/auth_test.go` covering allow, deny, permission-check error (`500`), and superuser bypass paths; ran `go test ./identity/middleware` (pass) and `go test ./...` in `examples/ecommerce` (pass/no test files).
- Notes: broader `go test ./identity/...` currently fails in `forge/identity/repository` with `pq: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "pg_database_datname_index"` (test DB isolation issue).
- TODO snapshot: open=500, new=11, resolved=11

- Changed: strengthened test DB creation in `forge/identity/testutils/db.go` by replacing timestamp-only naming with PID+timestamp+counter names, adding retry on Postgres `42P04` duplicate-database errors, and quoting database identifiers for create/drop cleanup.
- Tests: added `forge/identity/testutils/db_test.go` (`TestGenerateTestDBName_Unique`, `TestIsDuplicateDatabaseError`); ran `go test ./identity/testutils ./identity/repository -count=1` (pass), `go test ./identity/... -count=1` (pass), and `go test ./...` in `examples/ecommerce` (pass/no test files).

- Batch: ORM relation-path validation reliability (ORM/schema)
- Changed: replaced the nested relation-path TODO in `forge/orm/expression.go` by validating full field paths in `Field.Resolve` (relation-hop traversal, non-relation traversal rejection, relation-terminal rejection, and target-model lookup errors with explicit messages).
- Tests: added `TestFieldResolve_RelationPaths` in `forge/orm/expression_test.go`; ran `go test ./orm -run "TestFieldResolve_RelationPaths|TestFieldExpression_ToSQL|TestFieldRef_AllMethods" -count=1` (pass).
- Verification: `go test ./...` in `examples/ecommerce` (pass/no test files).
- Notes: default Go build cache path was permission-blocked; reran with `GOCACHE=C:\Users\hamid\AppData\Local\Temp\gocache`. Full `go test ./orm -count=1` still fails on pre-existing integration tests (`TestQuerySet_Integration_Filter`, `TestQuerySet_Integration_LimitOffset`) unrelated to this change.
- Remaining: executable ecommerce tests are still missing; ORM integration failures need triage; broad TODO/FIXME burn-down remains across admin/API/ORM/schema/migrations.

  - `RegisterAggregate`/`BuildAggregate`
  - `RegisterAnnotation`/`BuildAnnotation`
  - `RegisterQueryExpr`/`BuildQueryExpr`
- Tests: added `forge/orm/registry_test.go` covering registration, case/whitespace-normalized lookup, builder execution, and unknown-name failures; ran `go test ./orm -run "TestRegisterAggregateAndBuildAggregate|TestRegisterAnnotationAndBuildAnnotation|TestRegisterQueryExprAndBuildQueryExpr|TestRegistryBuilders_ReturnFalseForUnknownNames" -count=1` (pass).

- Changed: added first executable ecommerce tests in `examples/ecommerce/main_test.go` covering path normalization, dashboard registration, and reports plugin menu/page wiring.

- Changed: fixed `setFieldValue` in `forge/orm/queryset.go` to coerce scanned `[]byte` values into destination kinds (`string`, `bool`, signed/unsigned integers, floats) instead of silently leaving zero values.
- Changed: added regression tests in `forge/orm/queryset_test.go` (`TestSetFieldValue_ConvertsNumericBytes`, `TestSetFieldValue_ConvertsIntBytes`).

- Changed: added hook-reference extraction for identifier references, selector references, and inline function literals.
- Tests: added `forge/codegen/ast_parser_test.go` with `TestParseFile_ExtractsHooksFromStructLiteral`, `TestParseFile_ExtractsHooksFromBuilderChain`, `TestParseFile_ExtractsHooksFromAssignedVariable`, and `TestParseFile_HandlesNilHooks`; ran `go test ./codegen -count=1` in `forge` (pass) and `go test ./... -count=1` in `examples/ecommerce` (pass).

- Changed: replaced placeholder file-export TODO in `forge/log/exporters/file.go` with working in-process size-based rotation (max-size rollover, numbered backups, safe fallback to no-op writer on open failure); added thread-safe writer lifecycle (`Write`, `Sync`, `Close`).
- Changed: wired logger file output path in `forge/log/logger.go` to use `log/exporters.NewFileExporter(...)`, so `FileOutputConfig.Rotation` is now honored.
- Tests: added `forge/log/exporters/file_test.go` (`TestFileExporter_WritesToConfiguredPath`, `TestFileExporter_RotatesWhenMaxSizeExceeded`); ran `go test ./log/... -count=1` in `forge` (pass) and `go test ./... -count=1` in `examples/ecommerce` (pass).

- Changed: extracted reusable bootstrap path in `examples/ecommerce/main.go` via `buildEcommerceRouter(ctx, cfg, database)` so runtime wiring can be tested without starting `ListenAndServe`.
- Changed: added `TestBuildEcommerceRouter_HTTPReachability` in `examples/ecommerce/main_test.go` validating `/health`, `/admin/`, and `/api/v1/products/` reachability, with environment-aware skip when sqlite/cgo is unavailable.

- Changed:
  - `forge/identity/service/password.go`

    - `RequestPasswordReset(...)` now dispatches raw reset tokens through notifier when configured.
    - `ResetPassword(...)` now deletes consumed tokens by persisted token value (`resetToken.Token`) so hashed-token rows are removed.
  - `forge/identity/repository/token.go`
    - Enhanced `GetPasswordResetToken(...)` with hashed-token fallback (`getPasswordResetTokenByHash`) that scans valid tokens and verifies via bcrypt comparison.
  - `forge/identity/service/password_test.go`
    - Added notifier success/error tests.
    - Added hashed-token reset regression test asserting password update and token cleanup.

- Batch: CLI auth scaffolding production-readiness TODO closure (API/server parity)
- Changed:
  - `forge/cli/commands/project/auth.go`
    - Replaced scaffold TODOs for login/logout + JWT by generating concrete auth endpoints and handlers in scaffolded `app/auth/api.go`.
    - Added route registration for `POST /api/v1/auth/login` and `POST /api/v1/auth/logout`.
    - Added generated helpers: `generateJWTToken(...)` (HMAC-SHA256 signed token scaffold) and `writeJSON(...)`.
  - `forge/cli/commands/project/auth_test.go`
    - Added tests for scaffold output contents (login/logout routes, JWT helper, TODO removal).
    - Added existing-app guard test (`auth app already exists`).

- Changed:
  - `forge/db/migrations.go`
    - Added explicit nil guard in `NewMigrationRunner(...)` for `db == nil` before dereferencing `db.DB`.
    - Returns deterministic `database connection is nil` error instead of panicking during migration bootstrap.
  - `forge/db/migrations_test.go`
    - Added `TestNewMigrationRunner_NilDB` regression coverage for nil input behavior.
- Tests:
  - `go test ./db -count=1` in `forge` with `GOCACHE=C:\Users\hamid\AppData\Local\Temp\gocache` (pass)
  - `go test ./... -count=1` in `examples/ecommerce` with `GOCACHE=C:\Users\hamid\AppData\Local\Temp\gocache` (pass)
- TODO snapshot: open=500, new=3, resolved=3
- Remaining: support/engagement ecommerce parity still blocked by stubbed/non-SQLite module paths; admin UI `vitest` remains blocked by `spawn EPERM`; broader reliability/TODO burn-down continues across admin/API/ORM/schema/migrations.
