# Codex 24x7 Status

## Completed this run
- Improved `GetField` in `forge/orm/schema.go` to handle case-insensitive fallbacks for schema field lookups, increasing reliability when accessing fields dynamically via `SafeAccessor` without strict exact casing.
- Added comprehensive unit tests in `forge/orm/safe_accessor_test.go` confirming `SafeAccessor` correctly looks up fields using PascalCase, snake_case, and nested related references.
- Hardened migration runner initialization nil-safety in `forge/db/migrations.go`:
  - Added an early nil guard in `NewMigrationRunner(...)` for `db == nil` to return `database connection is nil`.
  - Prevents panic on nil receiver dereference (`db.DB`) during CLI/server migration bootstrap paths.
- Added regression coverage in `forge/db/migrations_test.go`:
  - `TestNewMigrationRunner_NilDB` verifies deterministic error behavior and nil runner result for nil DB input.
- Ran verification for this batch:
  - `go test ./db -count=1` in `forge` with `GOCACHE=C:\Users\hamid\AppData\Local\Temp\gocache` (pass)
  - `go test ./... -count=1` in `examples/ecommerce` with `GOCACHE=C:\Users\hamid\AppData\Local\Temp\gocache` (pass)

## Remaining work
- Continue high-impact TODO/FIXME burn-down across admin, ORM/schema/migrations, and API/server reliability paths in framework-owned source.
- Ecommerce support/engagement admin+API parity remains blocked by current module stubs and non-SQLite model stack in those packages.
- Admin UI unit tests remain environment-blocked (`vitest`/Vite `spawn EPERM`) in this runner.

## Next run plan
- Close one additional unblocked admin/API or ORM/schema/migrations reliability edge case with targeted tests.
- Expand ecommerce authenticated integration coverage for non-category modules where SQLite-backed paths are currently executable.
- Re-attempt admin UI unit tests once spawn restrictions are resolved; keep `STATUS.md` and `HISTORY.md` synchronized.
