# Codex 24x7 Status

## Completed this run
- Hardened database transaction initialization nil-safety in `forge/db/transaction.go`:
  - Added an early nil guard in `BeginTx(...)` for `db == nil || db.DB == nil` to return `database connection is nil`.
  - Prevents panic on nil receiver dereference (`db.DB`) during early bootstrap or misconfigured mock paths.
- Added regression coverage in `forge/db/transaction_test.go`:
  - `TestBeginTx_NilDB` and `TestWithTx_NilDB` verifies deterministic error behavior and nil transaction result for nil or uninitialized DB inputs.
- Ran verification for this batch:
  - `go test ./db -count=1` in `forge` with `GOCACHE=/tmp/go-build` (pass)

## Remaining work
- Continue high-impact TODO/FIXME burn-down across admin, ORM/schema/migrations, and API/server reliability paths in framework-owned source.
- Ecommerce support/engagement admin+API parity remains blocked by current module stubs and non-SQLite model stack in those packages.
- Admin UI unit tests remain environment-blocked (`vitest`/Vite `spawn EPERM`) in this runner.

## Next run plan
- Close one additional unblocked admin/API or ORM/schema/migrations reliability edge case with targeted tests.
- Expand ecommerce authenticated integration coverage for non-category modules where SQLite-backed paths are currently executable.
- Re-attempt admin UI unit tests once spawn restrictions are resolved; keep `STATUS.md` and `HISTORY.md` synchronized.
